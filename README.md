# Ray Tracing in One Weekend (Rust Implementation)
(Work in Progress)

This repository contains my Rust implementation of the ray tracing exercises described in the book *[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)* by **Peter Shirley**, **Trevor David Black**, and **Steve Hollasch**.

The project focuses on building a simple, yet powerful ray tracing renderer from scratch, exploring foundational computer graphics concepts such as rendering, light, color, and geometric intersections.

## ðŸ“– **About the Book**

*Ray Tracing in One Weekend* is a hands-on introduction to ray tracing, a rendering technique used to generate photorealistic images by simulating the way light interacts with objects. The book walks through the creation of a small ray tracer in C++.

This project reimplements the exercises and concepts using **Rust**, emphasizing safety, concurrency, and performance.

# Ray Tracing in One Weekend (Rust Implementation)

This repository contains my Rust implementation of the ray tracing exercises described in the book *[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)* by **Peter Shirley**, **Trevor David Black**, and **Steve Hollasch**.

The project focuses on building a simple, yet powerful ray tracing renderer from scratch, exploring foundational computer graphics concepts such as rendering, light, color, and geometric intersections.

## ðŸ“– **About the Book**

*Ray Tracing in One Weekend* is a hands-on introduction to ray tracing, a rendering technique used to generate photorealistic images by simulating the way light interacts with objects. The book walks through the creation of a small ray tracer in C++.

This project reimplements the exercises and concepts using **Rust**, emphasizing safety, concurrency, and performance.

## ðŸš€ **What This Project Does**

This implementation currently includes:

1. **Ray-Sphere Intersection**:
   - Rendering simple 3D scenes with spheres and a ground plane.
   - Calculating intersections between rays and objects.

2. **Materials and Shading**:
   - Adding diffuse, reflective, and transparent surfaces.
   - Simulating realistic lighting effects such as shadows and highlights.

3. **Camera**:
   - Implementing a virtual camera with adjustable parameters like field of view and depth of field.

4. **Multithreading**:
   - Leveraging Rust's concurrency features to render scenes faster.

5. **Output**:
   - Generating `.ppm` image files that showcase the rendered scenes.
